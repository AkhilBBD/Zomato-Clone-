# Zomato Clone Website
This project is a clone of the Zomato website, created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It aims to replicate the functionality and design of the original Zomato website, allowing users to search for restaurants, view collections, and explore various cuisines.

# Features

Restaurant Search: Users can search for restaurants by entering a city name. The website fetches restaurant data from the Zomato API based on the entered city.

Restaurant Collections: The website displays curated collections of top restaurants, cafes, pubs, and bars for the selected city. Users can browse through the collections and view details about each collection.

Cuisine Selection: Users can select a specific cuisine from a dropdown list to filter the displayed restaurants based on their preferred cuisine.

Restaurant Details: Clicking on a restaurant card reveals more information about the restaurant, including its name, user rating, cuisine, and address. Users can also click on the restaurant card to view photos of the restaurant.
